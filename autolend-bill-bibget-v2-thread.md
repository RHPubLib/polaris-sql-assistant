# Autolend — BibGetByType v2 (barcode→Bib) thread with Bill (ILS)

*Email chain captured for the record. Context: RHPL confirmed PAPI **BibGetByType v2**
with `?type=barcode` returns the Bib ID (Control Number / ElementID 11, off MARC 001)
directly from an item barcode — contradicting ILS's earlier claim that PAPI can't do
this and that a barcode→Bib ID dump would be required. Below are Bill McClendon's
(International Library Services) two replies and Derek's follow-up question. Related:

Derek,

Excellent!

Interesting, this is not on the V2 links I have for the documentation section under the Developers program.

I'll being that up with our Polaris Dev support POC.

Derek,

I have attempted this on at least 2 of our sites and it has not succeeded yet. It appears that URL is either not enabled for them, or it really is new in 8.1.x and they have not updated yet.

We will gladly switch to this for your implementation, if you choose the AutoLend.

BTW, it is still not listed as an option on the PAPI developers swagger pages.

Any idea why we can test it and it function and same with SILS (another Library system in Canada) and Phoenix uses it with their book locker system.

## Finding (2026-06-22) — it's NOT new to 8.1

Bill's "new in 8.1.x" theory doesn't hold up. Evidence:

- **Shipped in Polaris 7.6.** III's PAPI Revision History
  (`docs/papi-reference/PAPIRevisionHist.md`) lists BibGetByType as split into v1/v2 in
  **Polaris 7.6** — same release as the v2 PatronRegistration endpoints. The endpoint doc page
  is footered "Polaris Version 8.0." Not bleeding-edge.
- **Absent from Swagger everywhere — including ours.** Pulled RHPL's live spec from
  `https://catalog.rhpl.org/PAPIService/swagger/v1/swagger.json` (128 paths): **zero v2 paths of
  any kind**, no BibGetByType. So "not on the swagger pages" is true for RHPL too, yet it works.
  Swagger under-reports the v2 surface; it is not the authoritative list of live methods.
- **Why it fails for Bill's 2 sites:** the only bib endpoint Swagger exposes is v1
  `/public/v1/{LangID}/{AppID}/{OrgID}/bib/{BibID}` (expects a Bib ID, no `?type=barcode`).
  Testing from Swagger → barcode fed to v1 → fails, looks like "URL not enabled." The v2 call
  must be hand-built: `/public/v2/{LangID}/{AppID}/{OrgID}/bib/{barcode}?type=barcode`.
  Secondary check: PAPI public-method auth level — doc says auth required if set to ALL.
- **Multi-site confirmation:** Scott (SILS) was using this exact call at the **IUG 2024 hackathon
  in Denver**; the hackathon group routinely exercises v2 calls not in Swagger. Phoenix uses it
  in their locker system. RHPL, SILS, Phoenix → live and stable across multiple sites.

**Reply drafted to Bill 2026-06-22** (in Derek's Gmail drafts; subject *Re: Autolend —
BibGetByType v2 (barcode→Bib)*): conveys the 7.6 revision-history citation, the Swagger-omits-v2
point, the v1-vs-v2 URL gotcha, the SILS/Phoenix/hackathon corroboration, and the auth-level
check — closing that the barcode→Bib lookup works cleanly so no barcode→Bib ID dump is needed.
